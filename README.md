## Introduction
In the realm of mobile security testing, SSL pinning has become a common practice for apps like Facebook to enhance their security posture. However, with the use of tools like Frida and mitmproxy, it is possible to bypass SSL pinning and intercept the network traffic of Facebook on an Android device. This repository provides a step-by-step guide and resources to help you achieve this task efficiently.

## Features
- Bypass SSL pinning on the Facebook Android app.
- Intercept and analyze network traffic in real-time.
- Use Frida scripts to dynamically modify the SSL pinning checks.
- Explore mitmproxy for creating a man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy to intercept SSL-encrypted traffic.
- Stay up-to-date with the latest SSL pinning bypass techniques.
